# NYCU Computer Vision 2025 Spring HW1
Student ID: 110550085  
Name: 房天越
## Introduction
This is the first Homework of NYCU Visual Recognition using Deep Learning.
In this project, we need to use ResNetXX to train the model for Image Classification for 100 classes.
In my project, I used ResNeXt50, and I applied data augmentation to yield better results.
## How to install
First, install anaconda and create a virtual environment, the name is cvhw1 for example.
```
conda create -n cvhw1 python=3.9 -y
```
Second, install the dependencies in requirements.txt.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Performance Snapshot
Final Accuracy 0.92, not very good...
